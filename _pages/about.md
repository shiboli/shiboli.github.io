I am an Associate Professor at the School of Automotive and Transportation Engineering, Shenzhen Polytechnic University. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from Beihang University in 2009 and 2012, respectively, under the supervision of Dr. Zhiping Qiu. In 2016, I earned my doctorate from the University of Alabama, where I was supervised by Dr. Samit Roy.

From 2017 to 2024, I worked as a Principal Investigator at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research focuses on artificial intelligence diagnosis, biomechanical analysis, numerical methods in biomechanical and mechanobiology problems, and tissue-instrument interaction.

I have been awarded funding from prestigious sources, including the National Natural Youth Project, the National Key Research and Development Digital Diagnosis and Treatment Special Sub-project, and the Shenzhen Basic Research Key Project. I have published over 20 papers in international academic journals and conferences and hold more than five invention patents.

<!-- I am also an affiliated researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University \*of\* North Carolina \*at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org). -->
